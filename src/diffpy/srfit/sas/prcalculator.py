"""Nanoparticle form factor P(r) calculator.

The PrCalculator class wraps a sas.pr.invertor.Invertor object as a
Calculator. This is not wrapped as a ProfileGenerator because it will be used
to share information between SAS I(Q) to PDF G(r), but it does not use the same
profile as the PDF, which is where the calculator will be applied.

    This is provided so that SAS data can be used to calculate a nanoparticle

    a crystal-like nanoparticle:
