    Callable wrapper to a bound method stored as a weak reference.

    Support storage of bound methods without keeping the associated objects

    when method-related object is deleted.

    Attributes
    ----------
    function : MethodType
        the unbound function extracted from the wrapped bound method.
    fallback : FunctionType, optional
        plain function to be called when object holding the bound method
        gets deallocated.  The fallback function is called with this
        object as the first argument followed by any positional and
        keyword arguments passed for the bound method.  The fallback
        function can be used to deregister this wrapper.
    _wref : weakref
        weak reference to the object the wrapped method is bound to.
    _class : type
        the type of the object to which the method is bound.
        This is only used for pickling.
