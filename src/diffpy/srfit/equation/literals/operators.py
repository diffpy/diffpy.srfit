"""Operator classes.

Operators are combined with other Literals to create an equation. Operators are
non-leaf nodes on a Literal tree. These trees can be evaluated by the Evaluator
visitor, or otherwise inspected.

The Operator class contains all the information necessary to be identified and
evaluated by a Visitor. Thus, a single onOperator method exists in the Visitor
base class. Other Operators can be derived from Operator (see AdditionOperator),
but they all identify themselves with the Visitor.onOperator method.
