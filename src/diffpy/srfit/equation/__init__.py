"""The core equation evaluator for diffpy.srfit.

This package contains modules and subpackages that are used to create Equation
objects. The Equation class is an encapsulation of a lazy evaluation network
that is used throughout SrFit. The EquationsFactory class is used to create
Equation objects from strings and can incorporate user-defined functions as
well as default operations.

The subpackages define various pieces of the evaluation network.
