#diffpy.srfit

Configurable code for solving atomic structures.

The diffpy.srfit package provides the framework for building a global optimizer
on the fly from components such as function calculators (that calculate
different data spectra), regression algorithms and structure models.  The
software is capable of co-refinement using multiple information sources or
models. It provides a uniform interface for various regression algorithms. The
target function being optimized can be specified by the user according to the
data available.  

Within the diffpy.srfit framework, any parameter used in describing the
structure of a material can be passed as a refinable variable to the global
optimizer.  Once parameters are declared as variables they can easily be turned
"on" or "off", i.e. fixed or allowed to vary. Additionally, variables may be
constrained to obey mathematical relationsips with other parameters or
variables used in the structural model. Restraints can alo be applied to
variables, which adds a penalty to the refinment process commensurate with the
deviation from the known value or range. The cost function can also be
customized by the user. If the refinement contains multiple models, each model
can have its own cost function which will be properly weighted and combined to
obtain the total cost function. Additionaly, diffpy.srfit is designed to be
extensible, allowing the user to integrate external calculators to perform
corefinements with other techniques.

## REQUIREMENTS

The diffpy.srfit package requires Python 2.6 or 2.7 and the following software:

* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `matplotlib`

The functions in the diffpy.srfit.structure module require:

* `diffpy.Structure`
* `pyobjcryst`
* `diffpy.srreal`

The functions in the diffpy.srfit.pdf module require:

* `diffpy.srreal`

The functions in the diffpy.srfit.sas module require:

* `sans.pr`

Some of the required software packages may be available in the system package
manager, for example, on Ubuntu Linux the dependencies can be installed as:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib
```

For Mac OS X systems with the MacPorts package manager one could do

```sh
sudo port install python27 py27-setuptools py27-numpy py27-scipy py27-matplotlib
```

When installing for MacPorts, make sure the MacPorts bin directory is the first
in the system PATH and that python27 is selected as the default Python version
in MacPorts:

```sh
sudo port select --set python python27
```

For other required packages see their respective web pages for installation
instructions.


## INSTALLATION

The easiest option is to use the latest DiffPy-CMI release bundle from
http://www.diffpy.org/, which comes with diffpy.srfit and all other
dependencies included.

You can also use `easy_install` to download and install the latest release
from [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org)

```sh
sudo easy_install diffpy.srfit
```

If you prefer to install from sources, make sure all required software packages
are in place and then run

```sh
sudo python setup.py install
```

This installs diffpy.srfit for all users in the default system location.  If
administrator (root) access is not available, see the usage info from "python
setup.py install --help" for options to install to user-writable directories.
The installation integrity can be verified by changing to the HOME directory
and running

```sh
python -m diffpy.srfit.tests.run
```


## DEVELOPMENT

diffpy.srfit is an open-source software developed as a part of the DiffPy-CMI
complex modeling initiative at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The
diffpy.srfit sources are hosted at
https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.srfit/,

Feel free to fork the project and contribute.  To install diffpy.srfit in a
development mode, with its sources being directly used by Python rather than
copied to a package directory, use

```sh
python setup.py develop --user
```

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Part of the source code (_abc.py and _ordereddict.py) was derived from
python2.7 at http://svn.python.org/; while other code (observable.py)
was derived the 1.0 version of the Caltech 'pyre' project.
