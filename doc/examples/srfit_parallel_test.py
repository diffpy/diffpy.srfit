"""Example of a PDF refinement using diffpy.structure and PDFGenerator.

This is example of fitting the fcc nickel structure to measured PDF data. The
purpose of this example is to demonstrate and describe the classes in
configuraiton options involved with setting up a fit in this way. The main
benefit of using SrFit for PDF refinement is the flexibility of modifying the
PDF profile function for specific needs, adding restraints to a fit and the
ability to simultaneously refine a structure to PDF data and data from other
sources. This example demonstrates only the basic configuration.

    ## The Profile
    # This will be used to store the observed and calculated PDF profile.
    profile = Profile()

    # Load data and add it to the Profile. Unlike in other examples, we use a
    # class (PDFParser) to help us load the data. This class will read the data
    # and relevant metadata from a two- to four-column data file generated
    # with PDFGetX2 or PDFGetN. The metadata will be passed to the PDFGenerator
    # when they are associated in the FitContribution, which saves some
    # configuration steps.

    ## The ProfileGenerator
    # The PDFGenerator is for configuring and calculating a PDF profile. Here,
    # we want to refine a Structure object from diffpy.structure. We tell the
    # PDFGenerator that with the 'setStructure' method. All other configuration
    # options will be inferred from the metadata that is read by the PDFParser.
    # In particular, this will set the scattering type (x-ray or neutron), the
    # Qmax value, as well as initial values for the non-structural Parameters.

    # Here we associate the Profile and ProfileGenerator, as has been done
    # before.

    # The PDFGenerator class holds the ParameterSet associated with the
    # Structure passed above in a data member named "phase". (We could have
    # given the ParameterSet a name other than "phase" when we added it to the
    # PDFGenerator.) The ParameterSet in this case is a StructureParameterSet,
    # the documentation for which is found in the
    # diffpy.srfit.structure.diffpystructure module.
    phase = generator.phase

    # We start by constraining the phase to the known space group. We could do
    # this by hand, but there is a method in diffpy.srfit.structure named
    # 'constrainAsSpaceGroup' for this purpose. The constraints will by default
    # be applied to the sites, the lattice and to the ADPs. See the method
    # documentation for more details. The 'constrainAsSpaceGroup' method may
    # create new Parameters, which it returns in a SpaceGroupParameters object.
    from diffpy.srfit.structure import constrainAsSpaceGroup
    sgpars = constrainAsSpaceGroup(phase, "Fm-3m")

    # The SpaceGroupParameters object returned by 'constrainAsSpaceGroup' holds
    # the free Parameters allowed by the space group constraints. Once a
    # structure is constrained, we need (should) only use the Parameters
    # provided in the SpaceGroupParameters, as the relevant structure
    # Parameters are constrained to these.
    #
    # We know that the space group does not allow for any free sites because
    # each atom is on a special position. There is one free (cubic) lattice
    # parameter and one free (isotropic) ADP. We can access these Parameters in
    # the xyzpars, latpars, and adppars members of the SpaceGroupParameters
    # object.

        recipe.addVar(par)

    # We now select non-structural parameters to refine.
    # This controls the scaling of the PDF.
    recipe.addVar(generator.scale, 1)
    # This is a peak-damping resolution term.
    recipe.addVar(generator.qdamp, 0.01)
