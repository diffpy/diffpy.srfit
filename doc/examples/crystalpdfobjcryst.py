"""Example of a PDF refinement using pyobjcryst and PDFGenerator.

This example is similar to crystalpdf.py, except that here we refine a
pyobjcryst crystal object. In this example we use internal constraints provided
by the ObjCrystCrystalParSet structure adapter.

    # Load data and add it to the Profile. As before we use a PDFParser. The

    # structure being refined.

    # As before, we get a handle to the structure parameter set. In this case,
    # it is a ObjCrystCrystalParSet instance that was created when we called
    # 'setStructure' above. The ObjCrystCrystalParSet has different Parameters
    # and options than the DiffpyStructureParSet used in the last example. See
    # its documentation in diffpy.srfit.structure.objcrystparset.
    phase = generator.phase

    # Here is where we created space group constraints in the previous example.
    # The difference in this example is that the ObjCrystCrystalParSet is aware
    # of space groups, and the DiffpyStructureParSet is not. Constraints are
    # created internally when "sgpars" attribute is called for. These
    # constraints get enforced within the ObjCrystCrystalParSet. Free
    # Parameters are stored within the 'sgpars' member of the
    # ObjCrystCrystalParSet, which is the same as the object returned from
    # 'constrainAsSpaceGroup'.
    #
    # As before, we have one free lattice parameter ('a'). We can simplify
    # things by iterating through all the sgpars.
