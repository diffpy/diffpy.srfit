"""Example of using ProfileGenerators in FitContributions.

This is an example of building a ProfileGenerator and using it in a
FitContribution in order to fit theoretical intensity data.  ProfileGenerators
are used to organize profile calculators that require more information than can
be conveniently passed into a function call.  The IntensityGenerator class is
an example of a ProfileGenerator that can be used by a FitContribution to help
generate a the profile.

Instructions

Run the example and note the last line of the output. It will be described in
the code. Then read through 'IntensityGenerator' class.  This will motivate the
need for the ProfileGenerator class. Next read the 'makeRecipe' code.  This
will demonstrate how to use the generator, the structure container needed by
the generator and introduce new operations that can be used in a registered
equation.

Extensions

- The IntensityGenerator class uses the 'addParameterSet' method to associate
  the structure adapter (DiffpyStructureParSet) with the generator. Most SrFit
  classes have an 'addParameterSet' class and can store ParameterSet objects.
  Grab the phase object from the IntensityGenerator and try to add it to other
  objects used in the fit recipe. Create variables from the moved Parameters
  rather than from the 'phase' that lives in the IntensityGenerator and see if
  everything still refines.

    """A class for calculating intensity using the Debye equation.

    Calculating intensity from a structure is difficult in general. This class
    takes a diffpy.structure.Structure instance and from that generates a
    theoretical intensity signal. Unlike the example in gaussianrecipe.py, the
    intensity generator is not simple. It must take a structure object and some
    Parameters, and from that generate a signal. At the same time, the
    structure itself (the lattice, atom positions, thermal parameters, etc.)
    needs to be refinable.  Thus we define this ProfileGenerator to help us
    interface which exposes the Parameters required by the calculation and
    provides a way for a FitContribution to perform that calculation.

    The purpose of a ProfileGenerator is to
    1) provide a function that generates a profile signal
    2) organize the Parameters required for the calculation
