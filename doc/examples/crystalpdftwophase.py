"""Example of a PDF refinement of two-phase structure.

Like the ones before, this example uses PDFGenerator to refine a structure to
PDF data. However, for a multi-phase structure one must use multiple
PDFGenerators. This example refines a physical mixture of nickel and silicon to
find the structures and phase fractions.

    # In order to fit two phases simultaneously, we must use two PDFGenerators.
    # PDFGenerator is designed to take care of as little information as it
    # must. (Don't do too much, and do it well.) A PDFGenerator can generate
    # the signal from only a single phase at a time. So, we will create one
    # PDFGenerator for each phase and compose them within the same
    # FitContribution. Note that both generators will be associated with the
    # same Profile within the FitContribution, so they will both be
    # automatically configured according to the metadata.

    # name later when we set the fitting equation in the FitContribution.
