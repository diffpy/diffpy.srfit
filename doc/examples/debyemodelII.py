"""Example of fitting the Debye recipe to experimental Debye-Waller factors.

This is an extension of example in debyemodel.py. The recipe we create will
simultaneously fit the low and high temperature parts of the experimental data
with the same debye temperature, but different offsets. This example also
introduces constraints.

Instructions

Run the example and then read through the 'makeRecipeII' code to learn about
multi-profile recipes.  You will learn how to constrain related information
between the fit contributions.

Extensions

- Play with the fit ranges and see if you can improve the fit.
- The Debye temperature parameters from the two contributions can be
  constrained without creating a new variable. Try to figure out how that is
  done.
