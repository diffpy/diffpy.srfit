"""Building blocks for defining a lazy evaluation network.

Literals are the building blocks of the evaluation network. An Argument holds
the name and value of an equation variable. Operators are used to compose
other Literals to produce a new value.

Literal networks can be evaluated or have other actions performed on them by
Visitors (in diffpy.srfit.equation.visitors). The Literal-Visitor relationship
is that described by the Visitor pattern
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern).
