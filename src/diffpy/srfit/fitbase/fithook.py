"""The FitHook class for inspecting the progress of a FitRecipe refinement.

FitHooks are called by a FitRecipe during various times of the residual is
evaluation. The default FitHook simply counts the number of times the residual
is called, and reports that number every time the residual is calculated.
Depending on the verbosity, it will also report the residual and the current
variable values.

Custom FitHooks can be added to a FitRecipe with the FitRecipe.setFitHook
method.
