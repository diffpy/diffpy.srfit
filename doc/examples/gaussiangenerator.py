"""Example of using ProfileGenerators in FitContributions.

This is an example of building a ProfileGenerator and using it in a
FitContribution in order to fit a Gaussian profile. The recipe creation is much
like in gaussianrecipe.py, except that it uses our custom GaussianGenerator
class.  ProfileGenerators are usually used to organize profile calculators that
require more information than can be conveniently passed into a function call,
but can be used for simple calculations as well.  The GaussianGenerator class
is an example of a ProfileGenerator that can be used by a FitContribution to
help generate a the profile.

Instructions

Run gaussianrecipe.py and this example. Note how the output is identical. Next
read through 'GaussianGenerator' class.  This provides a simple example of how
to create a custom ProfileGenerator.  Finally read the 'makeRecipe' code to see
how the GaussianGenerator is used.  Contrast this to the 'makeRecipe' section
in gaussianrecipe.py.

Extensions

- Remove the amplitude from GaussianGenerator and instead use the 'setEquation'
  method of the FitContribution to account for it. Note that the
  GaussianGenerator will be accessible by its name, "g".

    Generating a Gaussian is not difficult, as was shown in gaussianrecipe.py.
    Here we create a class that encapsulates this functionality. Placing this
    class in a python module would make it possible to import it and reuse it,
    thereby saving future code writing and debugging.

    The purpose of a ProfileGenerator is to
    1) provide a function that generates a profile signal
    2) organize the Parameters required for the calculation

    Thus, this class overloads the __init__ method to create the necessary
    Parameters for the calculation, and the __call__ method to generate the
    signal.
