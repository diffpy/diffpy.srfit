"""PDF profile generator using the Debye equation.

The DebyePDFGenerator class can take a diffpy.structure,
pyobjcryst.crystal.Crystal or pyobjcryst.molecule.Molecule object and calculate
the PDF from it. This generator is especially appropriate for isolated
scatterers, such as nanoparticles and molecules.

    This works with diffpy.structure.Structure, pyobjcryst.crystal.Crystal and
    pyobjcryst.molecule.Molecule instances. Note that the managed Parameters
    are not created until the structure is added.

    Attributes:
    _calc   --  DebyePDFCalculator instance for calculating the PDF
    _phase  --  The structure ParameterSets used to calculate the profile.
    stru    --  The structure objected adapted by _phase.
    _lastr  --  The last value of r over which the PDF was calculated. This is
                used to configure the calculator when r changes.

    Managed Parameters:
    scale   --  Scale factor
    delta1  --  Linear peak broadening term
    delta2  --  Quadratic peak broadening term
    qbroad  --  Resolution peak broadening term
    qdamp   --  Resolution peak dampening term

    Managed ParameterSets:
    The structure ParameterSet (SrRealStructure instance) used to calculate the
    profile is named by the user.

    Usable Metadata:
    stype   --  The scattering type "X" for x-ray, "N" for neutron (see
                'setScatteringType').
    qmax    --  The maximum scattering vector used to generate the PDF (see
                setQmax).
    qmin    --  The minimum scattering vector used to generate the PDF (see
                setQmin).
    scale   --  See Managed Parameters.
    delta1  --  See Managed Parameters.
    delta2  --  See Managed Parameters.
    qbroad  --  See Managed Parameters.
    qdamp   --  See Managed Parameters.
