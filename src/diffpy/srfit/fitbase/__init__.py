"""The base fitting classes for diffpy.srfit.

This package contains modules and subpackages that are used to define a fit
problem in SrFit. Unaltered, these classes will help set up a fit problem that
can be optimized within a fitting framework or with a standalone optimizer.
They provide the basic framework for defining a forward calculator, and from
that defining a fit problem with data, constraints and restraints. The classes
involved in this collaboration can be tied to a fitting framework at various
levels through inheritance. One can create a fitting problem using the
FitContribution, Profile and FitRecipe classes.

Various code and design taken from Paul Kienzle's PARK package.
