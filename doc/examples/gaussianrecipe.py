"""Example of fitting a Gaussian to simulated data.

This is an example of building a fit recipe that can be driven by an optimizer
to fit a Gaussian profile to simulated data.  The purpose of this example is
familiarize the developer with the objects involved in defining a SrFit
refinement recipe.

Instructions

If you have not yet run the example, run it and inspect the output. The example
script is driven by the 'main' method defined below. Take a look at that method
to get an understanding of how a fit recipe can be used once created.  After
that, read the 'makeRecipe' code to see what goes into a fit recipe. After
that, read the 'scipyOptimize' code to see how the refinement is executed.
Finally, read the 'plotResults' code to see how to extracts the refined profile
and plot it.

Extensions

After reading through the code, try to perform the folowing tasks. The process
will leave you with a much better understanding of how SrFit works.

- Play around with setting the values of the Variables and Parameters. What
  happens to the associated Parameter when you change a variable value? What
  happens to the variable when you change the Parameter value?
- Modify the fitting equation by adding a constant. See if that improves the
  fit.
- Create a FitRecipe to fit the Lorentzian profile in the data/lorentzian.dat
  file.

    an optimizer can use to refine the variables to minimize the
    disagreement between the calculated profile and the data.
